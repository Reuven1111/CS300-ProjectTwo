# CS 300 – Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains portfolio artifacts from SNHU CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms. The work included demonstrates my ability to analyze algorithm efficiency, select appropriate data structures, and implement working solutions in C++.

## Project One – Runtime and Memory Analysis
This project analyzes the run-time and memory usage of multiple data structures and explains how these choices impact performance, scalability, and overall program design.

## Project Two – ABCU Course Planner
C++ program that:
- Loads course data from a CSV file into a Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Prints all courses in alphanumeric order
- Displays detailed information for a selected course, including prerequisite titles
- Follows the Project Two rubric using a single `.cpp` file

## How to Run Project Two
cd ~/Desktop/CS300-ProjectTwo
g++ ProjectTwo.cpp -o ProjectTwo
./ProjectTwo

## Files
- ProjectTwo.cpp
- courses.csv
- ProjectOne_Runtime_Memory_Analysis.pdf
